# Single-page-developer-portfolio


This is a solution to the [Single-page developer portfolio challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-developer-portfolio-bBVj2ZPi-x). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - Any field is empty
    - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- ###### Bonus: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- ###### Bonus: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
